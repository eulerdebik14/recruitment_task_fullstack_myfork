##  Author Notes
- The app handles the case where no current-day data is available (fallback to earlier days).

- Only ExchangeRatesHistory component is used, as it is more reliable than showing real-time only data.

- All calculations (buy/sell) are done dynamically on the backend.

- Minimal, clean design optimized for clarity and usability.
